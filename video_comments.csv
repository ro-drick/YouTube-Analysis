Many of my friends said they would like to buy mini but the battery life is so bad they have to stick with regular size. At the same time, not a single one cares about the thickness. Some other ones bought Pro instead because of better screen and materials. \nApple made and positioned an iPhone mini as a cheaper version of the same lineup. Which is not what mini crowd cares about. Give us thick iPhone mini with a good battery life, top notch screen and pro frame, put a price tag of Pro and 2-3 years of lifecycle. Call it iPhone Classic or something to not confuse anyone and this would be a hit IMHO"", 'The 12 Mini was my favourite phone ever size wise.

Asus had one big thing to fix, software updates. But no, lets keep that short support and make it huge!!!...', 'My pixel 3 is running out of storage but I love the phone. Perfect size, perfect specs.', ""There never was a small flagship without compromises. It was always not only display size (and battery obviously) which were reduced. Sometimes it was a chip, sometimes it was display quality, sometimes it was something else. Regarding examples: zenfone for me was never an option (and will not likely be), but taking it aside, I would not ever buy a phone with such ugly bezels. Regarding iPhone, mini was not a flagship. It was not a Pro mini, it was just mini. Other mainstream like samsung almost always made performance worse. Releasing a small phone is a risky strategy. And the law is as such: if you make it too cheap it will fail. if you make it too expensive - people would think like it is less phone for the same money. Kinda like with small cars. There is no issue to have a car with a size of VW polo, but fully packed with nice materials, tech and power. There even is a VW Polo with some luxury on it, called Audi A1 nowdays. But even this car is way worse in terms of materials, features, and impression when compared to a bigger one like VW Golf or Mazda 3, even though A1 costs roughly similar to those. (35 - 37 kEUR for sporty A1 vs 35 for almost fully packed, except maybe sunroof or electric seats Mazda, vs 32 - 39 for Golf GTI). So, to produce a successful mini, it should be feature packed as the full size, does not have any cheaper materials or cutbacks as improper bezels, so basically the only diff from full size should be a display and smaller battery. It should cost lesser than full size, though. And that's the challenge cause unlikely smaller display is massively cheaper than a regular one. I can think of a one way to make smaller sells maybe - to make it significant in some way. For example, sapphire glass or some rare material can be a feature of a smaller phone, micro-led displays also. So, the price of full size and small size can be closer then. And people who likes some luxury to have something unusual might like to buy smaller one then. But again it will work only in case you can't apply these for the bigger phone yet.""]"

The GOAT.\n\nIn case you didn't know, Samsung made a budget S series phone called the FE (fan edition) that had the processing power and speed of a flagship S series phone but was a few hundred dollars cheaper by cutting corners in the right places, mainly with a hard matte plastic backing and hard plastic screen.

People used to hate digital art and call it ""not a real art"" in 1990s and early 2000s. It changed. The attitude to AI art will change as well. \nThe reason people hate it is because generating slop became easy. 3 years ago artists charged $50 for a generic character drawing on an empty background with simple shading. Now they can\'t, and that makes them upset. But what you need to recognize is that is a very low-quality work that was overpriced AF.\nAt the same time take best digital artists - and AI is not Even close. I am not sure if you can create a piece of artwork that is comparable with a commercial artist from a big studio. It is 80/20 rule. We got 80% of the way now and a lot of people who just want a drawing of their character are very happy with it. But if you want a production quality concept art - You will have to hire an artist.

AI is literally based on the same nature or brains work with neural networks and is doing the exact same thing like a human: copying work from others ""in their brains"" and recreating it.\n\nNo one owns a voice tone or type of art style, that\'s the whole point of art in my opinion to freely express yourself and everything against this is oppressing that.\n\nThat are just greedy people in my opinion who don\'t care about that and just want to suck out money out of everything.\n\nIf you\'re inspired by Picasso\'s art style and draw exactly like him or have the exact same voice like Drake that\'s perfectly fine and doesn\'t mean you\'re not allowed to make music just because your voice sounds like Drake, no matter if you\'re a human, dog or AI.\n\nThis whole legal debacle should\'ve long been easily eliminated because of this basic common sense in my opinion.', '""not to take my job"" - but to take others. got it.......', 'The fact that I went ‚ÄúI am getting all the information I need in the first couple minutes‚Äù and then realized ‚Äúwait, this is an MKBHD video, they aren‚Äôt this short‚Äù', 'i think there must be another app to validate what AI generated in some specific subject.', 'Has anyone else watched the terminator movies?

Although I am benefitting from the extended software/security support period of the 6a, I have mixed feelings about the phone.  Unlike the 5a, the fingerprint sensor is very unreliable.  If your fingers are cold, or wet, or you are outside in bright sunlight, it is almost certain to fail.  The 5a had a headphone jack.  The 6a does not.  The 6a is VERY narrow, which means the keyboard is cramped, resulting in a LOT more typos than with the broader 5a.  Battery life on the 6a is a downgrade from the impressive 5a.  I have had no issues with the auto brightness, but in bright sunlight the screen is hard to see.  As for the camera, it's not great.  It cannot process aqua colors, and most photos are muted compared with reality.  Detail is limited. The water resistance rating for the 6a is lower than the 5a, but practically I will probably never notice the difference.  I hear what the reviewer is saying about the refresh rate and choppiness, but I have not found that to be a big deal.  I have not noticed any of the rainbow effects he referred to.  I will say that the 6a is the first phone I've had that both feels and looks FAR better in a phone case than in the raw. In a wood backed case the camera band actually looks slick and streamlined, rather than cheap and sharp edged like it does naked.  The speed of the phone is adequate, but so was the 5a.

You said that if we wanted a robot that could do something that we would build a robot that does that job specifically and it would be great at that job (better than a humanoid version).

But why build a new robot to perform a specific task EVERY single time we have a new task when we could build a humanoid robot which can then be programmed to do that task.

I\'d have to buy that robot too.

So rather than designing and purchasing an entirely new robot every time, we just take our existing humanoid robot that is performing tasks already in our house and download the ""cook me dinner"" software and we are off and running.  Sure, a custom designed robot for every task is going to be more efficient ... but a humanoid robot could theoretically do EVERY task a human can already do without any new hardware ... its just software at that point.  THAT is why they want to design it as a humanoid ... so that it can utilize every tool we have created throughout time to accomplish tasks just like any human.

Kind regards Peter :-)', 'is that the 11 or 12.9 inch table you are showing?', 'I think it\'s disappointing that Apple _needs_ to avoid cannibalizing their own products. It suggests to me that Apple is too stupid to innovate fully while making even more money. They need to limit the functionality of their own products so that each one is still worth something to their users. And while the original iPad seemed to be Apple\'s idea of a netbook, the modern iPads have gone so far beyond that that there\'s little difference in capability between their laptops and tablets, except where they make it.\n\nApple has a lot going for it, but being the cutting-edge master of technology is definitely not part of the equation. Their latest innovation is really a vast improvement over their ARM chips for phones and tablets. A previous one was using USB-C exclusively on their laptops starting with the 12-inch MacBook. And let\'s all remember the removal of the headphone jack and phone chargers! I assume there\'s a ton of software ideas they\'ve implemented, but none of them have been so far ahead of the competition that they can be claimed as innovations. Apple AirTags came out after Tile.\n\nI just don\'t think Apple is an exciting company. I was sold on them after my recent frustrations with Chromebooks and Chrome OS. There\'s no way I want a Windows laptop and I don\'t want to be bothered getting one only to install Linux on it. I\'d buy a MacBook because everything is so polished. But as far as I can tell, everything about Apple that could be called ""new"" isn\'t any more exciting than the latest indie game, mouse, TV, or law concerning our privacy rights. Apple just has a nicer package and presentation but their stuff is just a somewhat higher-quality version of stuff we\'ve already seen.\n\nApple is just a highly successful business that depends heavily on keeping up appearances and being just competitive enough that those already invested in Apple remain convinced that Apple\'s still the best. They are not the stupendous company some of us wish they were and they will never do anything so much better than the competition that it changes everything. Even their Apple silicon is limited to their own products and most everyone else is satisfied with the ARM processors in their phones already.\n\nI need to stop checking videos like this hoping it\'s something worth my attention. Apple, frankly, is just a very polished utility that refuses to outdo itself against its own financial self-interests, especially if it exposes just how utterly limited they are in their vision and willingness to be more than they already are and have been since Steve Jobs died.', 'I think the idea is simple. If iPad as a personal PC can wreck all category of markets (windows / Linux) then Apple go for making iPad a PC. They have no reason to dumb Mac otherwise. They evolve their products at the cost of another often to conquer markets across the spectrum. Like how iPhone killed iPod but iPhone also wrecked across the market giving them so much new money.', 'Ipad has the same problem as Iphone. Their OS is locked üîí and will remain locked üîí.\n\n The devices are deliberately handicapped to force you to ""buy the whole lineup"" or ""full ecosystem"". An Ipad will never do what a Mac can because than you dont buy the whole ecosystem...it just shrunk by a device and Apple\'s profits shrunk.\n\nFor some reason the limitations bother me more on the iPhone than on the Ipad since I need my phone to do more. I\'ve been okay using an Ipad for the odd Facetime call, email and as a media consumption device... but now Im questioning that.\n\nCurrently I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and every other device is Apple. However, I am considering ditching the Ipad and only using Mac. \n\nIt seems as though Samsung tablets are now better than Ipads simply because they are free devices that you fully own and can do anything you want with. \n\nOlder Samsungs lacked the power to really be usable but current gen are great tablets but can function as Chrome OS devices as well so you have full computer level functionality when you need it and full tablet functionality when you need it... something the Ipad can\'t offer.\n\nThe only drawbacks with Samsung tablets are they dont seem to be made to be used in portrait mode... primarily landscape. I\'m a musician and like to use a tablet for lyrics. Also, there are a few pesky apps not available on Android yet. Lumafusion going to Android is cool...but there are others I need. The growth of ChromeOS also causes Dex Mode in Samsung devices to get better. Hopefully soon it will have evolved to the point that it is as powerful as Mac OS or Windows.\n\nI don\'t know what to do...maybe time to go to Best Buy and compare the devices in store.']"

So it records as long as it's connected to power. It never shuts off, no matter how hot it gets. Oh, I forgot about wifi. That went out a week before the LCD went out. So I bought a few more new GoPro Hero Session 4 cameras (the ones that were simply called Hero Session) off offerUp, from folks who never used it or barely used it. I use them as back ups. While my 8 year old Hero 4 Session serve as a dash cam. I love this camera more than my GoPro 8. Although my GoPro 8 has superior quality, with stabilization.

I know to many of you the 90s were a time of backwards barbarism and you look at the 90s the way I looked at the 1970s or 60s, but as a teenager in the 90s I remember thinking these predictions were VERY COOL, but not unfathomable, they took existing technology and made educated guesses on where it would go. AT&T was also working with several tech companies, so they knew where this was all headed. They made realistic, grounded guesses, not sci-fi movie stupid guesses like flying cars or hoverboards. Touch screen tech was around way before the 1990s, it was even around in the 1960s, but not in the public domain.   The movie Die Hard in 1988 had the hero John McClane use a touch screen in the hotel that got hijacked, I used a touch screen in Disney World with my family in 1990.  Again, a lot of these technologies were in the embryonic phase in the early 90s, I remember thinking it was really cool in 1993 the idea you could do your homework with someone on the other side of the planet....by 1999 and 2000 this was a reality.', ""In 2023 we don't have Google Glass anymore unfortunately but we have something similar coming next year called Apple Vision Pro that seems to be the next big thing.

Newer devices - with newer features require tighter integration with OS and Hardware-- These types of integration can only be done by Apple themselves -- since they have total control over both the iOS Servers for the OS and the Hardware that they produce. any counterfeits or stolen parts -- make stealing these devices and reselling them -- pretty useless -- and perhaps that is what they were going for? <shrugs>\n\r\nSo essentially, these repair shops are just brokering or reaching out to apple on your behalf and requesting the genuine parts to swap out - while charging you an overhead margin fee on top of that. (which is why it cost more than just going directly to Apple)\r\nI\'ll just stick to my  PixelPro  - wifey still uses iPhone - but i guess we have to use the genus bar from now  on to do repairs.

I know what I am after: I love photography, cinematography, stability, great functions of the phone and its camera (playing with the filters), smoothness of the OS itself, great battery (or as good as possible, at least), great performance (mainly when playing games) and last but not least the design of the phone itself.\nThanks to this video in particular, I know more about both phones, having already some knowledge, although rather of the iPhone 13 Pro Max.\nI am truly impressed what S22 Ultra can do when playing with the camera, especially the Zoom, that is insane!!\nI also agree, based on the comparisons in the video, that the colors in the photo look uniquely on S22 Ultra. Like they are shining naturally, no detail is being missed. Without any offense to iPhone 13 Pro Max, where it looks great and sharp. One thing that I noticed is that iPhone has slightly darker photos, especially when the scene itself is captured in the evening. It is not a disaster, but it is noticeable when you look at both in the video.\nIt\'ll be a difficult decision for me, coz I got used to the smooth iOS system and its protection and other stuff on an iPhone, although my second phone has been model X, for a year and change, but honestly it is the worst iPhone ever - never experienced overheating and lagging so often, not even on model 8+.

It feels like they always push the message that you ""have to"" have the newest and most expensive phone to get a good mobile experience.\r\nBut the reality is that at least 50% of us are looking for good performance at a reasonable price. And this is where the channel really fails. They rarely mention more affordable options like Motorola or Xiaomi, which often offer significantly more for the money.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be summarized in the following points:\r\n\r\n1. Unrealistic picture of the smartphone market: Focusing solely on the most expensive models gives a skewed picture of the smartphone market. Most people cannot afford an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S-series, and there are many other excellent options at a lower price.\r\n\r\n2. Ignoring affordability: The channel does not take enough into account affordability. They seem to think that the only thing that matters is performance, regardless of the price tag. But for many users, the budget is an important factor, and they want to get the most out of their money.\r\n\r\n3. Missing out on good options: By focusing solely on iPhones and Samsung flagship models, the channel misses out on many good options from other manufacturers. Motorola and Xiaomi are just two examples of brands that offer excellent smartphones at a significantly lower price.\r\n\r\n4. Creates a feeling of inadequacy: Constantly seeing reviews of expensive smartphones can make viewers feel inadequate if they cannot afford such a phone. This can lead to dissatisfaction with their own phone and a feeling that they are not getting the best that the market has to offer.', 'Personally, I think Samsung absolutely perfected their smartphone design language and created the most aesthetically appealing looking phone design ever made with the introduction of the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. Samsung only improved on this design with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.

This is my absolute favorite device to watch any type of content on because of its television like aesthetic, not to mention writing notes using the S Pen is amazing. I love everything about the Samsung Galaxy S Series phones but I have a special appreciation for the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra smartphones.', '2 years later, is it worth it?']"

I think they are so much better. Not only because you get a better screen experience, but also it fits better with accessories. When holding it in one hand, just use your pinky finger to rest the phone on in your hand, so you are not jabbing the corner into your hand, it is something I naturally do with phones in my hand regardless of the size, and is just so much better to hold it that way and feels more secure in the hand. My S23 Ultra the best smart phone I have ever had, and whenever I look at my S10+, I just can't help but notice the rounded screen corners and how much I don't like that now that I have an S23 Ultra with really nice square corners on the screen. You just get more screen realestate making for better content viewing and gaming. I wont switch back to a curved edge phone, I simply wont do it. Curved screen on the other hand, the slight curve on the S23 Ultra is perfect, where the S22 Ultra's is a bit much, which is also the same with most other Samsung phones after the S7 Edge. I do not however like the new flat displays on the S24 series phones. Just another feature of the phone they have removed to make it seem more generic, like removing the 10x camera that made the phones special and people actually used, replacing it with a 5x that isn't anywhere near as good when zooming in. Just makes no sense why to downgrade the phone. Sure the film or whatever they have on the newer phones to reduce the reflection is nice, something screen protectors can do though, while protecting the screen, where that display on newer phones plus a screen protector actually makes the display look worse, and adds reflection, and if using an antiglare screen protector on one of those displays, it would look even worse. \n\nI just wish I bought a Note 10+ instead of my S10+ back in 2019 so I could be more used to the S Pen and other Note features that are on my S23 Ultra, but I still find ways to use my S Pen, and one great way is playing Nintendo DS and 3DS games through emulators, since both the DS and 3DS had a pen, which makes the S Pen so perfect in this case, also I use it for taking notes, because A, I really need to work on my hand writing, and B, making use of that Pen which is fun."", 'That‚Äôs your preference bro ‚Ä¶ what you don‚Äôt like is what we actually like so bad']"

It is a phone I have been wanting for a while, but with money being tight, I can't buy a brand new one as they are still out of reach in price, and used S23 Ultras are going for near new prices, but only for a little while more since the S24 Ultra release will lower some of these prices over time. The fact the S22 Ultra is around $900 CAD used, at least the 512gb, 12gb ram variants, and being almost no different then the other 2 Ultra's ahead of it, I personally think it is well worth getting one over the newer Ultra phones, even when taking into account the S22 Ultra still have 3 years out of 5 years, of complete support from Samsung, meaning it will still feel like a top of the line phone which it really still is, for another few years, and likely much longer after it will still feel like a phone that is near the top of all phones, just slowly making its way down where the S10+ 5 years later now feels like a mid range phone, with some good features that current mid range phones still don't have but you know, it isn't anywhere near as special as it was when it released, and I will probably end up putting my S10+ up on a shelf as it is still worth holding onto, where my older S8 wasn't really that special even then I first got it, and I don't own it anymore, quickly sold it after getting the S10+."", 'Watching this in 2024', 'watch this on 2023', 'I need someone to get galaxy s10+ for me, God Bless you as you help a brotherüôè', 'jsis', '86.

In this sense being a pessimist pays off because when you are surprised it is always pleasantly. :)\n\n\xa0So it does work even without the sun shining on it directly.\n\nMy advice would be to get a power bank and have that hooked up to the panel and charge the phone from the power bank.

Or of course if it is a really sunny day you can charge up both your phone and your power bank at the same time from the panel.\n\nI was hoping to buy something which would work even when conditions were not ideal (which is the norm in the UK) and I have to say that this solar panel delivers the goods and does what it says on the tin. Let's face it a percentage of something is better than 100% of nothing.\n\nI've tested it out by hanging it off the back of my rucksack whilst I was walking around, and quite a few people have come up to me and asked about it mostly thinking that I was advertising something. The weirdest thing was that I had people offer me money to let them charge up their phone.\n\nNow I always have a power bank with me and it has never and would never occur to me to actually accept money for charging someone's phone for them. It has happened when I am in a pub and I have been charging my tablet that someone has come up and offered me money to charge up their phones and I don't understand that.

BTW I like games on both systems', ""Great list,  wanna play Mighty No. 9 and Persona 4:DaN. >.< \nSony should make a new Vita. With more up to date technology, like better speakers, I've heard better audio from HTC and videos comparison of the HTC boom sound vs new Xperias front facing speakers show their on top of every other phone.  So I think the Zs speakers would be better that the one currently on the Vita. Also it be nice to have at least an HD screen, 720p is okay so that they keep the Vita compatibility so they don't have to upscale too much and use that as an excuse to remove backward compatibility.  Plus running games on 1080p would require a beast of a CPU/GUP.  Making it as costly as flagship phone and nobody would buy it. So 720p with 60fps capability with some of it games would do.  Better OS so its compatible with more media file format, better browser and stuff like youtube.  And I'd love some TV out,  I used it a LOT on the PSP.  The Shield Portable prove that you can pack amazing hardware and keep it at a reasonable price.  Market it like the rebirth of the Vita (since people keep saying that it's dead) and exploit things like 'the next step on portable gaming console' directly hiting against 3DS/New3DS and the vita itself, like the HD screen.  The Vita is okay, but the 3DS screen resolution is horrible.  And graphics aren't that good either.  Have one, enjoy it but I find Birth By Sleep on the PSP more pleasing to the eyes than Dream Drop Distance, and the PSP had disastrous resolution.  Still games like Crisis Core had better graphics than most 3DS games so I wont even compare it to the Vita.... Sorry I digress. Point the superior screen and speakers, maybe even add a second smaller set at the lower corners at the bottom and used them for effects like steps and the like.  Show it can connect to the TV for when you want to share.  They could even go as far as to make so that it can be use not only for remote play for the PS4 but as a second screen when gaming. So 1st player see something and 2nd player something else, it wouldn't be the first time they produce 2 different video signal, remember SimulView on PS3.  Man if I worked for Sony I could come up with a near perfect Vita 2/NeoVita/Vita R(ebirth)."", 'More Indies! smh!', 'blazblue looks cool but when you play it... meh also the story was not interesting at all.', 'if these are the best games i can nothing do but cry']"

If you like them than I'm glad you do. However if you want truly quality sound than you have been led into the wrong direction. Beats is generally overpriced crap that can be beaten by sub $100 headphones, anything by monster is made for consumers who either don't give a shit or can be persuaded with good marketing but there are much better headphones. You might have to do your own research but I'll get you started your going to want to get a headphone amp there are a wide range of options including desktop and portable designs. Second you want a good set of headphones and beats doesn't cut it. Brands that have good headphones include sennheiser, Audio technica, Grado, Think sound, Hifiman, Beyer dynamic, and Bowers and Wilkins (however B&W theare better know for their speakers) these are REPUTABLE brands and they offer Hifi products the same cannot be said about Monster, which I have nothing against them I just have different preferences and would advise different against purchasing their products. If you take my advice you begin to realize just what kind of advantages they has over shity overpriced headphones; they sound better that's the simple way of putting it. Like I said it does require you to do your research same goes with speakers. I also think gaming headphones are over hyped tech as well; if you listen to a good pair of stereo headphones the 3d imaging is quite surprising and can compete against digital dolbe and come out on top. You might say that you don't got the money for an amp and some headphones but they come at any price tag from $50-1000 (tip you can get audiotechnica A-30s (not A30x but A-30 they sound the same) for like $45 on Amazon these have a $80 list price but they are quite ugly but like I give a fuck; you can't see them when there on your head. Getting into is only expensive if you jump straight into the high end.""]"

A hacked PS Vita  allows for so much more on top of an already impressive handheld.\nJust a reminder but the PS Vita can play PS1, PSP, and PSV games natively. However, with time, patience, and basic understanding of software and file management  you can even explore hacked PS Vita further and then unlock the full potential of the handheld.  I've recently discovered how the download enabler application works with ROMs and Vita Shell. I'm still very impressed that with the download enabler application and a properly set up Vita Shell you can download and install ROMs directly from the handheld with no need for  a PC. Through my curiosity and research I  have now installed several games (mainly PSP) that were never released onto PSN nor ported physically. Such games as Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep, Tony Hawk's Underground 2 remix, SSX On Tour, etc. I think the biggest thing to keep in mind is there's a definitive line  between hacked and none hacked PS Vita. I'm sure that if Sony would  have taken the success of the PS Vita more seriously the device may have florished beyond that which is known of the handheld in modern times. It's sad to see how Sony was pushing their very expensive memory cards only for the hacking community to create a simple yet cheaper method of storage in the form of SD2Vita. It honestly amazes me  how the PS Vita hacking community was able to  FIX the majority of issues with Sony's original vision of the PS Vita.  The hacking community have collectively worked together to ensure Sony's beloved black sheep  portal lives on even after Sony's discontinuation."", ""This is perhaps one of the most retarded videos I've ever seen."", 'Psvita way better thats a phone connected to controller.
